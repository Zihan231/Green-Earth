# 1 What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans: 
Var is function scoped, that means it is accessible within the function as well as the blocks. Var enables redeclaring and reassigning a variable.
Let is block scoped, that means it is accessible within the block only. Let does not support redeclaring a variable with in the same scope. But we can reassign the value anytime.
Const is also block scoped.Const does not support redeclaring or reassigning
